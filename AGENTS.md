# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repo manages an Arch-based `gaming` distrobox with Ansible. Core playbooks
live in `ansible/`, reusable roles in `ansible/roles/`, defaults in
`ansible/group_vars/all/`, and machine-specific overrides in
`ansible/host_vars/localhost.yml`. Rendered desktop entries live under
`config/desktop/rendered/`; source templates live under role `templates/`.
Focused setup notes are in `docs/`. The native macOS baseline is a separate
stack under `macos/` and shares no code with the Linux tree — keep macOS
changes there and Linux changes out of it.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run commands from `ansible/` unless noted:

```sh
ansible-playbook site.yml                  # full setup
ansible-playbook --syntax-check site.yml   # validate playbook syntax
ansible-playbook install-sonic-p06.yml     # run optional P-06 setup
desktop-file-validate ../config/desktop/rendered/*.desktop
```

The macOS stack has its own checks, run from the repository root on a Mac:

```sh
bash -n macos/bootstrap.sh
python3 macos/tests/verify.py       # real Ansible, temp dirs, installs nothing
brew bundle check --file=macos/Brewfile
```

Use focused playbooks for optional apps (`install-xenia.yml`,
`install-pc-racing.yml`, `install-unleashed-recomp.yml`) instead of folding
large or user-specific installs into the default rebuild path.

## Ansible Path Customization

Never hardcode maintainer-local paths such as `/mnt/data`,
`/mnt/terachad`, `/run/media/akitaonrails`, or `/home/akitaonrails` in new
Ansible roles, templates, or active docs. Add or reuse `dg_*` variables in
`ansible/group_vars/all/*.yml`, derive paths from roots such as `dg_data_root`,
`dg_box_home`, `dg_external_games_root`, `dg_roms_final_root`, and document
overrides in `ansible/host_vars/localhost.yml.example`. Personal paths are
acceptable only as default values in central variables or as clearly historical
examples in archival docs.

## Reuse And Wine Game Patterns

Avoid duplicated Ansible logic. Before adding a new role or playbook, check
whether an existing role can be extended with data, variables, or a small shared
template change. For Windows games, prefer improving the reusable Wine/PC racing
flow instead of creating one-off install logic. Capture lessons from each tested
game, such as required `winetricks` components, DLL overrides, DXVK needs,
controller quirks, and installer flags, as data-driven `dg_*` variables so the
next Wine game benefits from the same path.

For each new Wine game, preconfigure the known display and controller baseline
before launch testing. Use gamescope with the shared 1440p `dg_pc_racing_*`
settings when a game can pick monitor modes directly, and explicitly choose the
per-game `Map Controllers` value instead of relying on trial-and-error after the
user tests. For legacy DirectInput games, prefer the role's Xidi support and a
per-game virtual controller mapping over ad hoc registry toggles when modern
controller triggers show up as permanently pressed axes. Document each game's
controller policy in `docs/pc-racing.md`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use YAML with two-space indentation. Prefix project variables with `dg_`.
Name roles with lowercase snake_case verbs, for example
`install_sonic_p06`. Keep shell snippets POSIX-compatible where practical and
quote paths because ROM names often contain spaces.

## Testing Guidelines

Before committing Ansible changes, run syntax checks for touched playbooks and
validate rendered `.desktop` files. For idempotent roles, rerun the playbook and
confirm the second run reports no unexpected changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commits use concise imperative messages, such as `Add Sonic P-06 install role`.
PRs should state what role or emulator changed, which commands were run, and
whether the change touches optional user-specific assets or the default rebuild.
